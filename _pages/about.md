## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science & Software Engineering at Auburn University. My research interests lie at the intersection of software engineering and system security, with a specific focus on Kubernetes security, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and empirical software engineering. I work under the guidance of Dr. Akond Rahman.

Prior to joining Auburn, I received my B.E. in Computer Science and Technology from Anhui Jianzhu University in China.
